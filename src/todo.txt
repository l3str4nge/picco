TODO:
- Single file class representation with metadata etc,
- add argument for date range (to proper collect images) -> this is for example for single backup
- create logger class for entire application with saving into file
- add oportunity for JSON files to declare whole config like:
{
    'wakacje1': [date1, date],
    .
    .
    .
    'wakaceN': [dateN, dateN+1]
} it will be easier to create whole backup
